# zerp - a compiler for Z

zerp is a compiler for Z, a toy programming language similar in syntax to
Python and Pascal. It targets a virtual machine written in Python that supports
a limited instruction set.

For more information on Z, see the [language reference](Z.md).

## Design

zerp is split into two parts: the compiler, that takes the high-level language
and compiles it into an assembled format, and the virtual machine, which takes
this assembled format and executes it.
